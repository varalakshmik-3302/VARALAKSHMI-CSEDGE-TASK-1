“This is a simple Java command-line chatbot that interacts with the user to open applications, search Google, or exit the chat. It reads user input with Scanner and uses Runtime.getRuntime().exec() to run system commands, handling errors with try-catch. The chatbot runs in a loop until ‘exit’ is typed and responds gracefully to invalid commands. This project helped me learn how Java can interact with the operating system and handle basic command-based automation.”
